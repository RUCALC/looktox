                "text": "In this study, we are interested in what babies recognize as counting before they start to count by themselves. We study this ability by measuring where babies look. For example, <a href='https://sites.sas.rutgers.edu/cognition/press.html#press' rel='noreferrer noopener external nofollow' target='_blank'>previous studies</a> showed that babies as young as 14 months remember more toys after watching the toys being counted, versus not being counted. This tells us that even before babies are able to count by themselves, they may already have a sense of what counting means. \n\n The current study asks what about counting is helping babies remember more. When replacing the familiar count words one, two, three with other words, such as this, this, this or A, B, C, do babies still recognize the activity as counting ? We try to answer this question by giving babies different numbers of toys to remember, paired with different versions of counting.\n\n This research would not be possible without awesome parents like you.Thank you again for your participation!",
