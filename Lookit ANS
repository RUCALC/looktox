                "text": "In this study, we are interested in whether babies can match how many things they see to how many sounds they hear. We study this ability by measuring where babies look. For example, a previous study showed that when newborn babies hear series of 4 sounds, they tend to look longer at pictures of 4 shapes, compared to 12 shapes. This tells us that babies can already tell 4 and 12 apart! \n\n The current study asks how this ability to tell numbers apart develops early in infancy. Specifically, babies that are about the age of your baby might be able to tell apart numbers that are closer together (such as 5 vs. 10) as well! \n\n This research wouldn’t be possible without awesome parents like you. Thank you again for your participation!",
