                "text": "In this study, we are interested in whether babies can match how many things they see to how many sounds they hear. We study this ability by measuring where babies look. For example, when babies hear series of sounds <a href='https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/114/45/11896.full.pdf' rel='noreferrer noopener external nofollow' target='_blank'>here</a>.) This study tries to see if even younger babies also have this ability. There is no right or wrong in your baby’s response! We just want to see, in general, what babies think and how they learn at different ages. \n\n The ability to connect emotional vocalizations to their probable causes is fundamental to human relationships, allowing us to empathize with, react to, and predict other people's experiences of the world. Most previous work on early emotion understanding has focused on children’s understanding of a few basic emotions or on broad distinctions between positive and negative emotions. In this study, we are looking at more fine-grained distinctions between specific positive emotions. \n\n This research wouldn’t be possible without awesome parents like you. To thank you for your participation, we’ll be emailing you a $5 Amazon gift card - this should arrive in your inbox within the next week after we confirm your consent video and check that your child is in the age range for this study. (If you don’t hear from us by then, feel free to reach out!) If you participate again with another child in the age range, you’ll receive one gift card per child. Thank you again for your participation!",
